A toy text adventure where commands have Haskell types.
Type ":help" to view the meta-commands.
> :help
:help       List the meta-commands.
:browse     List all the commands you can perform.
:inventory  List the objects you have picked up so far.
:quit       Abandon the quest (Ctrl-D works too).

It's locked.
> unlock

That random key you happened to carry in your pockets happens to fit the lock. What are the odds?

The door opens with a drawn-out yawn. You're in!
> :quit
